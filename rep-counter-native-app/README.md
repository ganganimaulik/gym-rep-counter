# Rep Counter Native App

This is a React Native Expo application for tracking exercise reps and sets. It is a conversion of the original PWA to a native app to ensure it works correctly even when the screen is locked.

## How to Run Locally

To run this application on your local machine, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. You will also need the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm.

```bash
cd rep-counter-native-app
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Metro Bundler

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Metro Bundler, which is the JavaScript bundler for React Native.

```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Run on Your Device

After starting the Metro Bundler, a QR code will be displayed in your terminal. Open the Expo Go app on your mobile device and scan the QR code to open the application.

-   **On iOS:** Open the Camera app and scan the QR code.
-   **On Android:** Open the Expo Go app and use the "Scan QR Code" option.

The app will then be bundled and launched on your device. You can now use the Rep Counter app.
